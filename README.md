# ProjectPeaceful
 
A long term project I plan to work on frequently during my free time.
I hope by keeping this repository public, it will work as a good example of my work for any potential employment in the future. 

The goal of the project itself is to create a character driven adventure/city building game that allows the player to work through conflict in ways other than combat. The player will explore differnet sections of the world and find unique characters to recruit to their settlement. Each character will offer certain bennefits once recruited, but will also need to be kept happy (through food, personal quests, or relationships with other characters). I would like the player to be able to develop strong relationships with each character, but I would also like characters to be able to develop bonds with each other as well.

Some major gameplay mechanics will be:
- Puzzle solving
- Dialouge
- Minor parkour
- A simplified farming system
